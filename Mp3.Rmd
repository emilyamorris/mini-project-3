####Problem Statement
Given the MacLeish data, we wanted to find out how the timing of the maple sugaring season is changing as a result of global climate change. 

####Introduction
Sugar maple trees, *Acer saccharum*, are a vital part of the economic and ecological systems of Massachusetts and the northeastern United States. Maple sap is collected and boiled down into syrup.

Maple sap production requires a delicate balance of weather conditions that are only achieved during “sugaring season”, or the spring season in temperate areas. Specifically, the temperature fluctuations must be such that the temperature is above freezing during the day, and below freezing at night. 

Global climate change stands to have a significant impact on maple tree function and distribution within the coming years. Fluctuations in climatic temperature and other conditions could lead to altered suitability of habitat and reductions in maple distribution in most of the United States by 2100. 

Tree health could be negatively impacted by acid rain, insect pests, and other ailments. The stress of surviving one ailment makes the tree more susceptible to other stressors; this lessens the likelihood of tree survival in the face of climate change. As more trees die off and the habitat becomes increasingly warped, tree distribution will continue to shrink.

#Attaining the whately live weather data from Professor Baumer's R package (this part is not our code)
macleish <- etl("macleish")

macleish %>%
  etl_update()

whately <- macleish %>%
  tbl("whately")

whately %>%
  mutate(the_year = strftime('%Y', when)) %>%
  group_by(the_year) %>%
  summarize(N = n(), begin = min(when), end = max(when), avg_temp = mean(temperature))


#Collecting the wild not-data set that whately is, getting the sap data and the forest data (this part is our code)
whately_data <- collect(whately)
sap <- macleish::maple_sap
forests <- macleish_layers[["forests"]]
```

####How does this relate to Smith?
Areas of maple trees where you collect sap are called "sugar bushes," and Reid Bertone-Johnson, manager of MacLeish, says that there are two owned by Smith and they collect sap from the sugar bush closer to the center of MacLeish, near the observatory and "bunker",
and that there is another sugar bush further into the property that they've never tapped but may in the future. 

Below, we wrangled the data and used leaflet to display where the two types of maple forests are located (dark green indicates sugar maple forests and light green indicates black-birch maple forest). These areas are not entirely one type of tree, but instead indicate where tappable trees can be found on the property. The observatory and bunker locations are marked, as is the Whately Monitoring Station from which all the weather data we used came from. This map shows the relation of the trees to the where the weather data comes from.

```

####The Data
We used the sap data and Whately weather data from the macleish package. 

####Sap Season Trends
Pictured below is the total number of days on which sap could be collected plotted against typical sugaring season months. It can be seen that the number of possible collection days increases in more recent years in months that previously would have been too cold to tap in, primarily January and February. Since tapping requires temperatures above freezing during the day and below freezing at night, this graph--along with other factors--is indicative of a warming climate. This graph represents only when it was possible to collect sap, not actual sap collection at MacLeish, which we took into account later in our analysis.

```{r warning=FALSE, message= FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height= 7, fig.align="center"}
#plotting to see some trends-- number of days sap was collected per month

The analysis we did on the MacLeish data is compatible with these climate change measurements and predictions from UVM, which show that warmer temperatures are leading to an earlier and shorter sap season.

####MacLeish Sap and Weather Trends, by Calendar Day
We thought it would be interesting to see what the mapling season looked like in calendar form, both to help us visualize the changes in weather over time and so that we could compare the actual collection days with the total possible days. These calendars map those data from 2012-2017. No sap collected in 2012 or 2016, but the weather data is still mapped below. The pattern of when sap was actually collected is compatible with the overall national trends of sap production. It is clear from these calendars that Smith's maple syrup ventures are actually pretty limited, and that across the years, despite the number of possible days, sap is only really collected in limited amounts. Predictions for Macleish's mapling season is therefore also limited, but warming climates do seem to be shifting the season from primarly March through early April towards mid February through late March.

#plotting all the years as calendars--can't use a function because calendarPlot doesn't allow you to add individual titles to things the way ggplot does, so either all the plots wouldn't have years signfied in their titles or we can just use the same code a few times.

####Conclusion and Suggestions
Smith College has the opportunity to ameliorate maple loss in a variety of ways. One option could be the creation and careful maintenance of a maple stand on the MacLeish Field Station property. Student labor could significantly cut costs for planting and routine maintenance, though the college would still be responsible for purchasing the original plants and other associated costs. Acer saccharum tend to reach maturity at 20 to 30 years of age and can grow to be 300 or even 400 years old. If new generations are planted to replace those lost, the project could continue indefinitely. Smith could also create a project much like that of the American Chestnut, wherein sugar maples could be initially bred with more hardy stocks and crossed back to almost genetic purity. This endeavor would be comparable with that of the American Chestnut project, presumably both in time and cost. 

The greatest roadblock would probably be that of maintaining the maple copse well into the future. Unless an effort is actively made to continue and evolve the project, it could fall into disuse and the maples could die off.

The hope is that this maple project would have a net positive effect on the local environment. Sugar maple trees are already a well established species in our local ecosystems, and therefore do not pose the threat of becoming an invasive species. The creation of maple forest could create a small carbon sink, and would not be as difficult to maintain as the vast swaths of pasture MacLeish currently has.

We would also recommend that data science students collaborate with MacLeish in order to improve record keeping practices, like numbering the tapped trees and marking their coordinates, so that we have a better idea with what is going on with maple trees in the area.
